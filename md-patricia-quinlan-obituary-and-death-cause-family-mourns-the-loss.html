The news of her passing has sent shockwaves through her family and beyond.</b></p><p>Her death news has prompted an outpouring of condolences and a collective sense of loss. Pat was constantly diligent and devised creative ways to be involved in and give back to our community.&nbsp;</p><p>She worked at the former Rexall Drug Store throughout high school and college alongside Otto Schulz, a buddy for life. She obtained her real estate license and returned to work once her kids left for college.&nbsp;</p><p>She later spent several years volunteering at the Reno Assistance League, a job she liked because of the people she worked with and the friends she made there.</p><p>Pat was a violinist when she was younger and later developed a passion for the Reno Philharmonic. The Sunday crossword problems were no match for her intelligence because she was also a skilled painter.&nbsp;</p><p>Be with us till the end to learn more about MD Patricia Quinlan obituary and other personal details related to her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=md-patricia-quinlan-obituary-and-death-cause></span>MD Patricia Quinlan Obituary And Death Cause<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On Friday, August 18, 2023, Pat Quinlan died quietly at her Reno, Nevada residence. The only child of Ramie and Meta Shull, Pat moved with her mother from Pueblo, Colorado, to Reno in 1935 when she was three years old.&nbsp;</p><p>There, she has lived for the following 88 years. Pat’s mother, who worked full-time as an accountant for a Reno doctor and then the Local Bartender’s Union, significantly impacted her life.</p><p>Pat attended the South Side School and graduated in 1951 with the final class from the original Reno High School. She was reared in the same Liberty Street home in downtown Reno, where she later started a family.&nbsp;</p><p>Pat was fortunate to have many lifelong friends, and she loved those relationships up until the end. She was actually extremely eager to attend her 1951 classmates’ monthly luncheon on the day of her passing.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-mourns-the-loss-of-patricia-quinlan></span>Family Mourns The Loss Of Patricia Quinlan<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pat’s favorite trip was the one she took with her husband Bob, as well as with Colonel Otto Schulz and his lovely wife Sally.&nbsp;</p><p>The four of them went on a month-long trip through Europe and Ireland together, making moments she would always treasure.</p><p>Both Pat’s son Paul J. Quinlan and her devoted husband, Robert J. Quinlan, passed away before her.&nbsp;</p><p>Her daughter Carol, son Mark and daughter-in-law Diana, two grandsons, Ryan and Kellen, Ryan’s wife Kendall, and two great-grandchildren, Ireland and Jack Quinlan, remain.&nbsp;</p><p>She also leaves behind her daughter Carol. We would like to thank Pat’s numerous friends for their unwavering love and support. Pat lived a blessed life; she will be remembered for her grace, elegance, and kindness.&nbsp;</p><p>Her family also wants to express their gratitude to Dr. Michele Kiser, her primary care physician, for the excellent care she provided.</p><p>On Thursday, September 14, from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., a Celebration of Life was held at the Renaissance Hotel Shore Room (a longtime favorite of Pat’s) after a private burial at Mountain View Cemetery.&nbsp;</p><p>Her family had invited everyone who knew and loved Pat to join them in honoring her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWUYr2iwNGimqKZXabCqrrLmqVmp5Kewbat0bJkmqaUYrGmrdOhZJyZpaiybrLApqClsV2ivLa%2BzaxkraCVYrmwv9Jo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nicki-minaj-kenneth-petty-sentenced-failing-to-register-sex-offender.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nicki Minajs husband Kenneth Petty sentenced after failing to register as a sex offender">&larr;
