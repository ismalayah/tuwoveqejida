He even revealed in the past that he had DM’ed&nbsp;her while she was still pursuing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clayton Echard</a> on his season of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bachelor</a>&nbsp;— how sweet is that?</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>While on season 19 of&nbsp;The Bachelorette, Tyler and Rachel had an undeniable connection, securing a rose at the final four and making it to hometown dates, however, he was sent home just moments before the duo was supposed to go meet his family.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">While things did not work out with Rachel</a>, Tyler found love for a second time on season 8 of Bachelor In Paradise with the one and only <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brittany Galvin</a></strong>.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>Brittany did not have the best reputation on season 25 of The Bachelor, where she joined the competition in week three, ready to pursue a relationship with the handsome <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt James</a>. She and four other women were late arrivals that season, which naturally stirred the pot upon their entry into the house.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>Both stemming from the Windy City, Anna Redman claimed to know Brittany from back home, falsely accusing her of being an escort and causing a ruckus within the mansion. Despite having a connection with Matt, the Chicago native was sent home during week five, likely due to the drama she had caused.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tyler-Norris-and-Brittany-Galvin-1.png><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>Despite being rather unsuccessful on their respective seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, Tyler Norris and Brittany Galvin hit it off on the shores of Mexico, ending the season as one of the final six couples and leaving with each other.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>The duo did not get engaged, however, they planned to pursue a relationship with one another outside of the villa. Unfortunately, Tyler and Brittany ended things shortly after filming, and the breakup is sure to raise a few eyebrows…</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>During the “After the Final Rose” special, it was revealed that Tyler invited Brittany to a party in the City of Angels shortly after Bachelor In Paradise wrapped. Brittany revealed that she could not attend the party due to the fact that flights to Los Angeles were extremely expensive. Being the kindhearted human that he is, Tyler offered to pay for her. However, she refused to accept his generosity.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>While looking out for your finances is understandable, things quickly took a turn for the worse. Just days after Brittany refused to meet up with Tyler in Los Angeles, she bought tickets to Europe for herself. While in Italy, Brittany broke up with her Bachelor In Paradise lover via FaceTime, simply because their “goals didn’t line up” and she wanted him to regain some independence – how cold-hearted is that?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Brittany-Galvin.png><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>While Brittany received a lot of backlash post-breakup, she set the record straight on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bachelor Happy Hour</a> podcast with co-hosts Becca Kufrin and Thomas Jacobs.</p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>She began by sharing what led her to break up with Tyler in the first place, explaining how a lot of their relationship was not in the public eye: “Immediately after filming, I went to Jersey for the Fourth of July, and we spent the entire week together, and then right after, he said he hadn’t been to a Cubs game, so I took him to a Cubs game. We did all of that in Chicago before his season really started airing. I felt like everything happened so fast.”</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>“After we met each other’s families and friends, I had some serious conversations with him about where we saw ourselves in the next few years. We had to figure out if we’d make the jump and move to the same city or try to keep doing long distance. After we had a few conversations, I expressed to him that I needed a break, but that never really happened,” Brittany explained, before diving into the breakup itself.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>“A lot of people sent me hate for breaking up with him over FaceTime, but when you only dated someone for a month and a half and you live long distance, I don’t really know the way you’re supposed to go about it,” she dished, which made the circumstances of the split far more understandable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tyler-Norris-and-MERCEDES-NORTHUP.png><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>According to her <a href=#>Instagram profile</a>, which has amassed over 125,000 followers, the “sexy and sassy” woman seems to be living her best life, with confirmation that she will not be hitting the beach for Bachelor In Paradise this season.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>On the other end of things, Tyler seems to be hitting it off with the stunning&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mercedes Northup</a>, who had her fingers crossed that he would be returning to&nbsp;Bachelor In Paradise&nbsp;this season, according to the tea she spilled on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Click Bait with Bachelor Nation</a>&nbsp;podcast.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>Going on a date under the stars that was seriously to die for, will their connection continue to grow?
