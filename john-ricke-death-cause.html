He returned to his alma mater as a teacher in 1996 and never left.</p><p>He taught various courses in social studies, including world history, U.S. history, government, economics, and psychology. He also coached the school’s Academic Decathlon team and advised the National Honor Society. He was respected by his colleagues and loved by his students, who appreciated his enthusiasm, humor, and patience.</p><p>“He was a phenomenal teacher who made learning fun and engaging,” said Sarah Johnson, a senior who had Mr. Ricke as her world history teacher last year. “He always had a smile on his face and a joke to tell. He cared about us as individuals and helped us grow as learners and citizens.”</p><p>Mr. Ricke was also a mentor to many young teachers who joined the school over the years. He shared his experience and wisdom with them and supported them in their professional development.</p><p>“He was a role model for me and many others,” said David Lee, a social studies teacher who started working at Lincoln High School in 2018. “He showed me how to be an effective and compassionate educator. He was always there to offer advice, feedback, or encouragement.”</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>John Ricke</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Date of Birth</td><td>June 15, 1971</td></tr><tr><td>Date of Death</td><td>September 25, 2023</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Occupation</td><td>Social Studies Teacher at Manitowoc Lincoln High School</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Bachelor’s Degree in History and Education from the University of Wisconsin-Madison</td></tr><tr><td>Family</td><td>Wife: Jennifer Ricke; Sons: Matthew Ricke and Michael Ricke; Parents: Robert and Mary Ricke; Siblings: James Ricke and Julie Ricke</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Devoted_Family_Man_and_a_Friend></span><strong>A Devoted Family Man and a Friend</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mr. Ricke is survived by his wife of 25 years, Jennifer Ricke, a nurse at Holy Family Memorial Hospital; his two sons, Matthew Ricke, 22, a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee; and Michael Ricke, 19, a freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; his parents, Robert and Mary Ricke; his brother, James Ricke; and his sister, Julie Ricke.</p><p>He was also a loyal friend to many people who knew him since his childhood or met him through his work or hobbies.
