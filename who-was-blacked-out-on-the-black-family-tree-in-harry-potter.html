Judging by the Black family’s pure-blood pride, being non-magical in any sense would presumably be deemed shameful u2013 even if the person couldn’t help it.</strong></p><p>Is Harry Potter on the Black family tree? Family history</p><p>The Black family traces its origin back to the Middle Ages. They claim to have entirely magical ancestry, but as Sirius Black informed his godson Harry Potter, no true pure-blood families existed by the twentieth century.</p><p>Simply so, How is Harry Potter related to the Black family? The female line of the House of Black, however, continues through Harry’s children, James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter and Lily Luna Potter, whose maternal great-grandmother is Cedrella Weasley née Black, also making Harry related to the House of Black <b>via marriage</b>.</p><p>What is Sirius Black’s family tree?</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Sirius Black</th></tr><tr><td>Affiliation</td><td>Order of the Phoenix</td></tr><tr><td>Family</td><td>Bellatrix Lestrange (cousin) Narcissa Malfoy (cousin) Regulus Black (brother) Harry Potter (godson) Orion Black (father) Walburga Black (mother) Phineas Nigellus Black (great-great-grandfather)</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr><td>House</td><td>Gryffindor</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Draco_related_to_Sirius_Black></span>Is Draco related to Sirius Black?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He marries Narcissa Black and together they have one son, Draco, who is the first Malfoy family member introduced in the series. The Malfoys are related to the Black family through Narcissa (a <b>first cousin of Sirius Black</b>, Harry’s godfather), which makes Draco a nephew of both Bellatrix Lestrange and Andromeda Tonks.</p><p>Also Are Narcissa and Bellatrix sisters? Bellatrix is a member of the Black Family and is the cousin of Sirius Black. Bellatrix is the daughter of Cygnus and Druella Black and <b>sister to Andromeda</b> (mother of Nymphadora Tonks) and Narcissa (mother of Draco Malfoy).</p><p>Is Neville pureblood? The Longbottoms</p><p>Look at Neville Longbottom – <b>he’s pure-blood</b> and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up. ‘ Neville comes from a long-line of pure-blood wizards, although we don’t know as much about the individuals as we do with some other wizarding families.</p><p>Is Bellatrix related to the Weasleys? The Weasleys descend from <b>Cedrella Black</b>, a granddaughter of Phineas Nigellus Black. Sirius Black, Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy all descend from Pollux Black (left). … (Sirius correctly notes the relationship in Order of the Phoenix.) Given that, Sirius can call the seven Weasley children his third cousins.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Draco_Malfoy%E2%80%99s_crush></span>Who is Draco Malfoy’s crush?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pansy Parkinson is a supporting character in the Harry Potter novels and some of the films, and she is Draco Malfoy’s Love Interest.

A Family Affair</p><p>In Order of the Phoenix, Bellatrix kills her first cousin Sirius, only to later be killed by Molly Weasley (<b>Bellatrix’s second cousin once removed</b> by marriage).</p><p>Is Andromeda Black?</p><p>In Greek mythology, Andromeda was <b>originally depicted as a black princess from Ethiopia</b>, but Renaissance art repeatedly depicts her as white.</p><p>What is Narcissa’s Patronus? Everyone has a patronus, but Narcissa’s <b>patronus is unknown</b>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Luna_Lovegood%E2%80%99s_husband></span>Who is Luna Lovegood’s husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Luna Lovegood</th></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td><b>Rolf Scamander</b></td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Lorcan Scamander Lysander Scamander</td></tr><tr><td>House</td><td>Ravenclaw</td></tr><tr><td>Born</td><td>13 February 1981</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Is Fleur a pureblood?</p><p>Fleur is <b>a pureblood</b>, isn’t she? She’s only Half-Veela because her mother, a Half-Veela, married a wizard, who is not a Veela and both of Fleur’s maternal grandparents were Veelas. She’s NOT a Half-blood at all.</p><p>How did Bellatrix get pregnant? Malfoy Manor, Delphini’s place of birth Delphini was born in secret at Malfoy Manor in the mid-to-late 1990s as the result of a liaison between Bellatrix Lestrange and Lord Voldemort. … Euphemia Rowle took <b>Delphi</b> in and raised her, allegedly only because she was offered a substantial amount of gold.</p><p>Is Molly Weasley related to Sirius Black? On the subject of Molly, it is interesting to note that she is <b>Sirius’s cousin by marriage</b> by virtue of her marriage to Arthur.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_are_Rodolphus_Lestrange_parents></span>Who are Rodolphus Lestrange parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rodolphus Lestrange was a pure-blood wizard, brother of Rabastan, son of <b>Reinhard Lestrange</b> and a Slytherin student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was a Death Eater who fought in the First Wizarding War.</p><p>When did Harry fall in love Ginny? At age eleven Harry saw Ginny for the first time at King’s Cross Station in 1991. However, they did not formally meet until <b>the summer of 1992</b>, at which point it became blatantly clear that Ginny had a huge crush on Harry.</p><p>Who is Harry Potter’s crush?</p><p><b>Cho Chang</b> is well known for being Harry Potter’s first crush, first kiss, and first girlfriend in the Harry Potter books and films.</p><p>Does Harry like Hermione? <b>Harry is not sexually attracted to Hermione</b> – he never has been. He does acknowledge that she is pretty at the Yule Ball. Hermione even earns a full paragraph describing everything from her hair to her dress to her teeth.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_married_Neville_Longbottom></span>Who married Neville Longbottom?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>We now know that Neville ended up marrying <b>Hannah Abbott</b> and became Herbology Professor at Hogwarts. Plus he and his wife lived above the Leaky Cauldron. Neville finally got his happy ending – and here’s why he deserved it more than anybody else.</p><p>Who is Bellatrix husband? <b>Rodolphus</b> and Bellatrix Lestrange</p><p>She marries Rodolphus Lestrange, and they both loyally devote themselves to Voldemort. In Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, we learn that Bellatrix has a secret baby with the Dark Lord named Delphini, who was conceived towards the end of the Second Wizarding War.</p><p>How are Harry and Ginny related?</p><p>In any case, Harry and Ginny are <b>somewhat distant cousins</b>, since Charlus is the cousin-in-law of Cederalla, Ginny’s grandmother, thought honestly it would be a hell lot easier to simply relate the Potter’s and Weasley’s through Harry and Ginny’s children, their genes through them would forever connected so to speak.</p><p>What age is Nymphadora Tonks?

Lupin’s death is a sore spot for many fans, who fell in love with the werewolf, nicknamed Moony.</p><p>Don’t forget to share this post 🖤</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1kxKm7jLCYrGWSoa6kt8SdZKitpGK8r3nToZxmmpyWsKx5xZqkoqSpYsGzscRmoKdlmJa%2Fs8WMqaatrJWnfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./banette-ex-scarlet-26-violet-88.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Banette ex (Scarlet &amp;amp; Violet 88)">&larr;
